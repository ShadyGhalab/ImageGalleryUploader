[ReactiveSwift Page](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift)
 [FBSnapshotTestCase Page](https://github.com/uber/ios-snapshot-test-case)

- Dependencies are provided by Carthage. Why Carthage over CocoaPods? Because of: ( I would have used  Swift Package manager with the new Xcode but it's still beta ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ)
    - Carthage does not have Xcode workspace.
    - Carthage builds framework binaries using xcodebuild.
    - Carthage has been created as a decentralized dependency manager.

- Why am i using ReactiveCocoa and ReactiveSwift?
    -  UI Binding.
    - Multithreading is simplified
    - Cleaner Code and Architectures.
